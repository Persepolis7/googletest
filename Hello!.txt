Hello!

Louis has been searching for the perfect pebble for months now, but all the ones he’s seen are too dull and too boring and just not right, and Harry deserves nothing but the best. Louis wants to keep searching indefinitely until he finds the perfect pebble, but yesterday he saw Nick huddling very close to Harry and he fears he’s running out of time. Nick is an excellent choice in a life mate, much to Louis’ chagrin. He’s got lots of extra blubber that would keep Harry warmer in the winter, his coloring is bright and beautiful, and he always brings Harry fresh krill from the ocean. Louis probably doesn’t stand a chance, but he still has to try. Ever since Harry tripped over his own two feet and crashed into Louis, sending them both slipping and sliding down an ice hill, Louis has wanted to be Harry’s life mate. He may not be the most beautiful or the fattest penguin, but he still believes he can protect Harry, keep him safe and warm and make sure he doesn’t trip and fall and break one of his flippers.

Love u!
XOXO
